JAN 24

AFTER BREAK:
  -make update form able to handle updates
  -check track update controller action
  -verify that that the whole process works
  

TO FIX: 
  Change the Users controller index action get tracks as well and
  have that action return an array of all the track ids for that user

  Have the tracks create action add in the new track into the user list
  Have the tracks destroy action remove the track id from the user list

  

For Track CRUD:
  -make a simple upload container where there is a button that allows a signed in 
    user to upload a track and an image and attach them.
  -make a button that will destroy a track and its associations
  -create a simple form for updating
  -style the upload page
  -find a simple way to trigger song play (though not continuous)
  

  -make a protected route for upload container
  -have this simply display a form with title, a place to upload a file,
   and a place to upload an image. 
   For now, we can disable albums, and instead just do playlists. I don't see 
   on the main part of soundcloud where one can upload or group files into an album.
   
  For this feature, for now, let's shoot for having two nav bar headings, upload, and your tracks.

styling
  -the whole fadein / move down is a transition. 
  -I should be able to connect them. 

______

/When Splash Page Renders, fetch all users and e-mails.
/update mdp
/create backend route
/create api util actions
/Create Jbuilder support for returning all users
/create controller actions
/Update users reducer to receive them

-then-
on sign in
  /add error option to checking credentials
  /dispatch errors 
  /create an errors reducer to handle those
  /include errors styling in login form

on sign up
  /stage 1 - first check if email is legit and password is greater than 6 characters
  /stage 2 - make sure they entered an integer
  /stage 3 - make sure the username is unique
    if all succeed, submit

  to do this:
  /make SESSION_STAGE_ERRORS
  /have incrementStage clear session errors
  /map dispatch to props for checkStageErrors and incrementStage
  /create checkStageErrors

____

[COMPLETE] For the signin option, it should only require an e-mail. 
  That's in session create. 


[complete] For the signup option, it is a 3-phase signup. Though soundcloud will make an account after
only partial information, I will wait until all information is supplied to dispatch the create action.
Can only supply e-mail in phase 1.


_______


REMOVE TUROBLINKS!

_______

Maybe later: 
adjust user model so that it can accept either a username, renamed to profile-url, or an e-mail. 

Either should work. 
The regex for profile-url should accept a string of firstname-lastname-integer
The regex for e-mail should accept a valid e-mail
If neither regex patterns is supplied, then it should return a 401 status.
  Changes need to be made to the following database-level functions:
    -user model needs to be updated to receive first
